# C:DDA - Awakened Furries Mod
source: https://github.com/onura46/cdda-awakened-furries

This mod fills a niche I noticed in the CDDA community; players would often debug in fursuits or furry traits. This introduces scenarios that require you to become a furry. You start with a fursuit and a mission to transform! These scenarios are not compatible with vanilla CDDA canon, and exist for utility and fun only!

Compatible with 0.F and experimental versions released in that time period.

Current scenarios:
- Cat-boy/girl
- Wolf-boy/girl
